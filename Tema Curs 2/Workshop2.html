The FIFA men's World Cup has featured 32 teams for the last six editions, since France 1998.

            On March 31 FIFA released their updated FIFA World Rankings, which were used to sort the teams into separate pots ahead of the draw held on April 1. Each 2022 World Cup group consists of one team from each of the four pots below. The top eight teams in the World Rankings (as of March 31) went into Pot 1, the next best eight teams into Pot 2 and so on. Pot 4 also contained the three placeholders for the spots yet to be claimed. This process helped ensure there is competitive balance across the groups. (FIFA World Ranking on March 31, 2022 added in parentheses below. *Qatar was included in Pot 1 as the host nation, which is a FIFA tradition at World Cup events.)

            With the 2022 World Cup less than a year away, the hosts Qatar have already unveiled seven of the eight planned venues for the global showpiece tournament. While Stadium 974 was officially unveiled a few weeks back, Al Bayt stadium became the latest venue to be inaugurated on Tuesday during the opening day of the FIFA Arab Cup. Al Bayt, a 60,000-seater venue designed to resemble the tents historically used by nomadic people in the Gulf region, hosted Qatarâ€™s 1-0 victory against Bahrain. The stadium will also host the opening match of Qatar 2022 in just under a year.
            The inauguration of Al Bayt was attended by the Amir of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, who officially announced the start of the tournament. Let us have a look at the other stadiums which have already been launched.

            Influencer Cup The Influencer Cup is a tournament for content creators from different parts of the world that will take place in Doha, Qatar, on March 28 and 29. The event, which is organized by the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, will be contested at the 974 Stadium, one of the eight venues that will be used at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The tournament will gather four teams, with more than 25 influencers involved in the action. Content Creators will represent their continents (Europa, Americas, MENA and Asia) in a 5x5 competition spread in two phases: a Round Robin group stage on the first day and Final and Third Place on the second. In both days, games will start at 2pm local time and can be followed on Roadto2022 and GOAL social channels. The event will also gather Qatar Legacy Ambassadors and other FIFA legends like Cafu, Samuel Eto'o, Tim Cahill, Javier Mascherano, Lothar Matthaus and Marcel Desailly, who will be involved in the activities across both days. Sponsored by Qatar Airways, the Influencer Cup is a rare opportunity to see football content creators from several places to engage with their counterparts using football to connect. Between the participants, high-profile influencers like Billy Wingrove, Sean Garnier, Werevertumorro and Morena Beltran are among the players.
